# Security-audit-simulation

The files in this repository are to show my understanding and ability to accomplish a security audit. The audit was completed on a fictional company named *Botium Toys*.
The files named "Botium Toys Audit Scope and Goals" and "Botium Toys Risk assessment" were provided to me.

I used the information in the noted files to complete the following:
- Compliance Checklist
- Controls Assessment
- Stakeholder Memorandum
